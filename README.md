# A Cross‚Äëmodal Lag-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Safety Domain Discrimination in Nuclear Power Systems

![image](https://github.com/JinlinYY/CLGC/blob/main/Abstract_graph.png)

Official implementation for ‚ÄúA Cross-modal Lag-aware Graph Contrastive Learning Framework for Safety-Domain Discrimination in Nuclear Power Systems‚Äù.
The framework builds a lag-aware heterogeneous sensor graph over multi-rate operation (OP) and dose (DOSE) streams, performs temporal encoding + heterogeneous message passing, and optimizes multi-granularity contrastive objectives for robust, interpretable safety-domain inference.
